Que :- Localstorage vs session storage?
Ans :- Local storage is implemented using the HTML5 Web Storage API, which provides two mechanisms for storing data on the client-side: localStorage and sessionStorage. localStorage is used for long-term storage of data, while sessionStorage is used for short-term storage that is only available for the duration of a browser session.

Que :- How Localstorage works?

localStorage is a way to store key-value pairs in the browser that persists even after the browser is closed. Here are some methods that can be used with localStorage:

    localStorage.setItem(key, value): This method sets the value for a given key in localStorage.
    Example: localStorage.setItem("username", "John")

    localStorage.getItem(key): This method gets the value for a given key in localStorage.
    Example: localStorage.getItem("username") // returns "John"

    localStorage.removeItem(key): This method removes the value for a given key in localStorage.
    Example: localStorage.removeItem("username")

    localStorage.clear(): This method clears all the key-value pairs in localStorage.
    Example: localStorage.clear()

Note that the value in localStorage can only be a string. If you want to store an object or an array, you need to first convert it to a string using JSON.stringify() and then store it. Similarly, when you retrieve the value, you need to parse it back to an object or an array using JSON.parse().

If we get two keys with same name than it overwrite previous one.
