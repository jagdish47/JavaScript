console.log(1 == "1"); //true
// there is type coersion when we compare number with stirng the string will convert into number in (==)

console.log(typeof null); //object
// How do we create empty Object.
let obj = {}; //we use this to create empty objec

// but back in days when JS was created people use to create empty object using null, so that's why null type is object
let newObj = null;

console.log("1" == "1"); //true
console.log(1 == "1.0"); //true
console.log("1" == "1.0"); //false becasue both are stirng and string both are not equal or not same.

let n; //Initialization or Declaration
n = "Yuvraj"; //Assignment

n = "Bhima"; //Reassignment
